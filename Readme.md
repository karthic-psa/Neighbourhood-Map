Project Overview:
Developed a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood. Added functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

About this Project:
The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable.

Libraries, frameworks and APIs used:

1. Knockout JS
2. Google Maps API
3. Foursquare API
4. Bootstrap
5. JQuery

What I learnt:
Learnt how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase. Explored how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for us to use. Finally, implemented third-party APIs (Google Maps API, Foursquare API) that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of our application.

Instructions on using the project:
1.) Download the files.
2.) Just open index.html.
3.) Click on the markers or the list items to see more information about it in an infowindow.
4.) Type in the filter/search box to filter through the loactions/markers.
(All the required libraries and dependencies are already included.)
